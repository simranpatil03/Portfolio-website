I have huge passion for learning and experiencing new things. It's this passion that made me adapte new trends and mastering new tools. I also believe in team work with a strong belief that any work is done with outstanding team work. Apart from technology I have intrest in various indoor games such as card games and ludo and outdoor games such as football and cricket.
